    History
    It was believed that Chhindwara District was full of "Chhind" trees (wild date palms) many years ago, and the place was called "Chhind"-"Wada" (wada means place). Another story says that due to the population of lions (called "sinh" in Hindi), it was considered equivalent to entering the lions' den to enter this district. Hence, it was called "Sinh Dwara" (lit. 'Lion Gate'). In course of time, it became "Chhindwara".
    <br>
    The Gole Gunj market of the city, with its two large gateways (known today as Kamania Gate), was built by Captain Montgomery, who administrated the district as a regent of Richard Jenkins (1818–1830). The municipality of Chhindwara was founded in 1867.</p><br><br>
